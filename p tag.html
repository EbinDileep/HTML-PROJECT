    <h1>peace</h1>
    <p>Peace is the A of life, not the Z of life. It is the most fundamental thing. If you don't have anything else, at least you must be peaceful. Peacefulness is being projected as the highest thing because when someone has a disturbed mind, peace will be the highest goal in their perspective.
